This project invites visitors to explore Pixar’s movie history through a hands-on experience. By turning the dial, visitors explore different Pixar films throughout the years, with each title and critic rating appearing on a small screen. If the dial lands on one of the Cars movies, Lightning McQueen’s lights turn on, his wheels spin, and makes noise, which is a celebration of a franchise that means a lot to us, even if critics didn’t love it. Through interaction and a bit of humor, this piece highlights how personal favorites don’t always match up with critical opinions, encouraging visitors to think about what makes a film meaningful to them.
