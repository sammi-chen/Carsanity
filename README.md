This would be in a museum exhibit, designed for Pixar fans and museum visitors, providing a fun and engaging way to explore Pixar’s film history while celebrating the Cars franchise.

This project invites visitors to explore Pixar’s movie history through a hands-on experience. By turning the dial, visitors explore different Pixar films throughout the years, with each title and critic rating appearing on the screen. If the dial lands on one of the Cars movies, Lightning McQueen’s lights turn on, his wheels spin, makes noise, which is a celebration of a franchise that means a lot to us, even if critics didn’t love it. Through interaction and a bit of humor, this piece highlights how personal favorites don’t always match up with critical opinions, encouraging visitors to think about what makes a film meaningful to them.

We’re using Eric Leung’s Pixar dataset, which includes structured information on every Pixar film from 1995-2024, and we’re specifically focusing on critic ratings to determine
when Lightning McQueen should activate.
